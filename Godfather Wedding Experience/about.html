            <h3>Connie Corleone, The Godfather Wedding Experience</h3>
            <p> Connie Corleone with the help of her family founded The Godfather Wedding Experience after hearing engaged couples comment that there weren’t enough hours in the day in which to organise an Italian destination wedding. She also noticed that couples were concerned by the minefield of paperwork that they would have to get through, all on top of the challenge of dealing with quirky, Italian ways! </p>
            <p>With invaluable knowledge of Italy and Italian traditions based on her family’s Italian heritage and  planning her own Sicilian  traditional wedding, Connie realised that she could share her love of the beautiful country by helping couples plan their dream Italian weddings: The Godfather Wedding Experience empire was born.</p>
            <h3>Getting Married in Italy? Speak to Connie now to plan your dream Italian Wedding Day.</h3>
            <p>Since 2005, Connie has built a strong profile in the Italian wedding industry through her passion and strong work ethic and with valuable family connections based on previous successful business endeavours. The Godfather Wedding Experience has grown into a boutique company with an Anglo-Irish wedding planning and design team, all of whom excel at delivering the perfect wedding day. </p>
            <p>We provide a holistic wedding catering to the needs of each couple individually. We pride ourselves on being a complete family run business.
